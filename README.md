## Insta Clone
### Requirements
- Pin the navbar to the top so it stays up when you scroll down the page. Give padding to the body so that it does not merge with the content.
- The height of the navbar should be 54 px and the background color should be white.
- Have you noticed that the elements in the navbar are not in the right place? First of all, give a 192px left margin inside the logo class at the beginning of the navbar.
- Center the search section with d-flex and give 5 units of margin on the left.
- Add the search icon in the assets folder to the background of the ::placeholder section in the CSS file. And make sure the picture doesn't repeat.
